## The Lambda Library

Some boastful name for my humble collection of solutions to code challenges I partook
in and other snippets I created to explore things. As the title suggests I'm a functional
programmer, my weapon of choice being Clojure, although I'm just learning Haskell and
pay my bills with FP-style JS/TS.

#### Rationale

I don't believe in code golf. I'm a professional, and it feels just wrong to write
code that takes longer to read than it would to solve the problem from scratch.

Also, it's more fun (and more future-proof) to be able to read the developer's thoughts
in var names and the likes.

Anything posted here might not be production quality, but it will have nicely named 
functions and variables, and I will try hard not to be too obscure.

#### Technical facts

This page is created with [Cryogen](https://cryogenweb.org) and uses a custom theme based
on [PureCSS](https://purecss.io) for the navigation and [MilligramCSS](https://milligram.io/)
for the rest. Code highlights via [Prism](https://prismjs.com).  
My thanks go to all their contributors for enabling me to create such a simple setup.

#### The author

dabbling in functional programming he is a lazy athlete, patient dog owner, loving husband, and
sometimes despairing father.  
Also he likes typing long sentences, using a lot of commas.
